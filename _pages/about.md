Welcome! This is Guoning, currently working toward my Master degree in Electronic Information with the [School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Bo Yan](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/info/1450/11649.htm). Now, I am a research assistant at [HiLab](https://hilab.uestc.edu.cn/) of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by Prof. [Guotai Wang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z2sFN4EAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on medical image analysis, particularly in annotation-efficient learning for medical image segmentation. This includes techniques such as domain adaptation, self-supervised learning, and leveraging foundation models (e.g., SAM) for application. My work also aims to extend these methodologies for practical clinical applications, such as computer-aided detection and diagnosis.
